The GNUstep CoreBase Library is a library of general-purpose,
non-graphical C objects.  For example, it includes types for strings,
collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations, notifications,
notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports, and event loops.

It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of Apple's CoreFoundation framework.
